## Final Conclusions

- **Inventory Gaps:**  
  - eDreams is missing a number of lower-priced itineraries that Kiwi offers—69 for MAD-NYC RT and 125 for BCN-DPS RT—indicating an opportunity to better capture the budget market.
  
- **Price Competitiveness:**  
  - eDreams is at a disadvantage in pricing for both journeys. The significant number of lower-priced Kiwi itineraries (69 for MAD-NYC RT and 125 for BCN-DPS RT) suggests that many price-sensitive customers might prefer Kiwi.

- **Segments Structure:**  
  - For the DPS journey, eDO stands out by offering a strong peak at 4 segments, indicating more convenient flight options.  
  - For the NYC journey, both OTAs offer similar itinerary structures.

- **Carriers Distribution:**  
  - Kiwi tends to include more carriers per itinerary compared to eDreams. In the DPS case, eDreams itineraries are limited to up to 2 carriers, while in the NYC case, most Kiwi itineraries involve more than 3 carriers.

- **Strategic Opportunity:**  
  - eDreams should consider negotiating better rates or implementing dynamic pricing strategies to improve competitiveness.
  - Enhancing the value proposition through better service or travel conditions may help justify the higher prices.

By addressing these opportunities, eDreams can refine its strategy to capture a broader market share and better serve price-sensitive travelers.
